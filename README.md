To install, download this repository as a zip file and extract all the files and subfolders in OrmerodWebControl-master into the www directory on the SD card. File README.md is not needed on the SD card and may be deleted if desired.

As of version 68 this requires RepRapFirmware 057z-dc42 or later. You can find the firmware at:

Follow the link to the desired version and use the Raw button to download it.
